# File Encryption and Decryption Tool

## Project Overview 

This project aims to create a simple tool for encryption and decrypting files using Python. The tool will provide users with a secure way to protect their files.

## Features 

## 1. Encryption

- Users can specifiy a file to encrypt
- The tool uses a secure encryption algorithm (e.g. from the 'cryptography' library)
- Encrypted file is saved with a new name or in a specified directory

## 2. Decryption

- Users can specify a file to decrypt
- The tool uses the same algorithm to decrypt the file
- Decrypted file is saved with a new name or in a specified directory.

## 3. Command-Line Interface 

- Implement a simple CLI where users can provide commands and options to encrypt or decrypt files
- Examples CLI commands:
    - 'python encrypt.py --file my file.txt  --output encrypted/myfile_encyption.txt'
    - 'python decrypt.py --file encrypted/myfile_encrypted.txt --output decrypted/myfile_decrypted.txt

## 4. Key Generation

- Implement a mechanism for generating encryption keys.
- Users may have the option to provide their own key or let the tool generate one

## 5. Algorithm Options 

- Explore different encrpytion algorithms
- Allow users to choose the encryption algoritm to use

## Learning Goals 

- Practise file handling in Python
- Gain experience with encryption and decryption using the 'cryptography' library.
- Build a simple command-line interface.

## Additional Notes 

- Document any challenges faced during development.
- Record decisions about the project's design and functionality
- Keep track of resources and references used.
